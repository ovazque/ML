- [Housing](https://github.com/ovazque/ML/blob/main/Housing.ipynb) <br />
  This notebook uses a data set on housing prices in California. The goal is to predict prices of houses based on different attributes. The project commences by implementing basic data visualization techniques. It generates the training (using stratified sampling) and testing sets. Also, data cleaning and feature scaling with pipelines are implmented. At the end, the predictions from a linear regression and random forest models are compared. This notebook is based on the End-to-End ML project discussed in Chapter 2 of Ref. [2].
